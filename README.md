# @probable-futures/climate-change-assistant

This chainlit app will use an [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and the [Probable futures](https://probablefutures.org/) API to provide climate change information for a location, and provide some helpful resources for how to prepare.

The chainlit app is based off the cookbook example [here](https://github.com/Chainlit/cookbook/tree/main/openai-assistant).

## Setup

You will need a probable future API key, see [here](https://docs.probablefutures.org/api-access/) for more details. You will also need an [OPENAI key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python).

Setup a Conda environment ...

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) by selecting the installer that fits your OS version. Once it is installed you may have to restart your terminal (closing your terminal and opening again)
2. In this directory, open terminal
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. `conda activate climate-env`

If you add a new dependency, run `conda env update -f environment.yml` to install it or to update existing ones.

Once you have these, then ...

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set OpenAI key and Probable Futures API user and secret
3. Create assisstent with `python3 create_assistant.py`
4. Copy the assiostant id from output and put into `.env`

If you make changes to the assistant, rerun `create_assistant.py`, which will update the existing assistant.
